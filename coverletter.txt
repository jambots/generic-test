I have been developing interactions using Javascript, CSS and HTML5 Canvas with a focus on programmatic animation and responsive, data-driven interfaces. My latest app, developed for Radio K at the University of Minnesota is based on the Adobe PhoneGap Build service and is my first app to appear on both the iOS App Store and Google Play. 

HTML is common to every operating system on every desktop, mobile device, and soon even televisions. Be aware that I do not write native code such as Java or Objective C. This decision frees me to target all platforms using my existing skills while engaging in the work I am truly passionate about, design and mathematics. 

Visit Jambots.com to see a selection of my iOS apps including games, music education, and more. The most impressive one is Railroad Train. 

While I am proud of having created residual income from my independent apps, I am now looking for a team environment where I can contribute more to create world class products.
